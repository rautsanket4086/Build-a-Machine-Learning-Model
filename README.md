# Build-a-Machine-Learning-Model
Build a Machine Learning Model to predict whether an owner will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year.

# Background

The auto insurance industry is witnessing a paradigm shift. Since auto insurance company consists of homogenous good thereby making it difficult to differentiate product A from product B, also companies are fighting a price war (for insurance price). On top of that, the distribution channel is shifting more from traditional insurance brokers to online purchases, which means that the ability for companies to interact through human touchpoints is limited, and customers should be quoted at a reasonable price. A good price quote is one that makes the customer purchase the policy and helps the company to increase the profits.

Also, the insurance premium is calculated based on more than 50+ parameters, which means that traditional business analytics-based algorithms are now limited in their ability to differentiate among customers based on subtle parameters.
# Process Flow
The Machine Learning model mainly consist of two phases:
1. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):
Analyze the datasets to summarize their main characteristics (with visual methods). A statistical model can be used, primarily EDA can be used to see what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.
2. Machine Learning Modeling:
After EDA, the modeling comes into the process. The process of training an ML model involves providing an ML algorithm (that is, the learning algorithm) with training data. The term “ML model” refers to the model artifact that is created by the training process.
