Build a Machine Learning Model to predict whether an owner will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year.

# Background

The auto insurance industry is witnessing a paradigm shift. Since auto insurance company consists of homogenous good thereby making it difficult to differentiate product A from product B, also companies are fighting a price war (for insurance price). On top of that, the distribution channel is shifting more from traditional insurance brokers to online purchases, which means that the ability for companies to interact through human touchpoints is limited, and customers should be quoted at a reasonable price. A good price quote is one that makes the customer purchase the policy and helps the company to increase the profits.

Also, the insurance premium is calculated based on more than 50+ parameters, which means that traditional business analytics-based algorithms are now limited in their ability to differentiate among customers based on subtle parameters.
